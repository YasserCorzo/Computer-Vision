Course Description
This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. Topics covered include image formation and representation, 
camera geometry, and calibration, computational imaging, multi-view geometry, stereo, 3D reconstruction from images, motion analysis, physics-based vision, image segmentation and object recognition. The material is based on graduate-level texts augmented with 
research papers, as appropriate. Evaluation is based on homeworks. The homeworks involve considerable programming exercises.

Description of hw assignment is described in each directory in the file "hw{num}.pdf" and my report to the assignment is in file "Homework_{num}_report.pdf".
